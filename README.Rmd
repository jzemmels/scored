An R package to compare cartridge cases and compute similarity scores based on their breech face impressions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of scored from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jzemmels/scored")
```

## What the heck are you talking about?

A *cartridge case* is the metal casing that holds the projectile, propellant, and primer of a cartridge (you might refer to them colloquially as a "brass" or "shell").
When a firearm is discharged and the projectile travels out of the barrel, the cartridge case pushes against the back wall of the barrel, known as the *breech face*, with great force.
Markings on the breech face surface, attributable to manufacturing, use, wear, etc., are "stamped" into the surface of the cartridge case, leaving so-called *breech face impressions*.
Analogous to a fingerprint, forensic examiners have used these breech face impressions to identify the firearm from which a cartridge case was fired.

It is possible to capture digital representations, such as images or topographic scans, of cartridge case surfaces and compare these representations on a computer.
We have developed a suite of tools available in this R package for *automatically* comparing cartridge case scans.
The primary intended use of the `scored` package is to compute numerical features between pairs of cartridge case scans that measure the similarity of their breech face impressions.

## Feature calculation

As an example, consider two cartridge cases fired from the same handgun (see [here](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249874.pdf) to learn more).
The cartridge cases are given unique character-based IDs `K013sA1` and `K013sA2`.
Because these cartridge cases were fired from the same firearm, we assume that they share similar markings left by the firearm barrel on their surfaces.
The code below loads important packages and the two cartridge cases.

```{r setup,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(scored)
library(impressions)
library(tidyverse)

data("K013sA1","K013sA2")
```

Below is a visual of the two cartridge case scans using the `impressions::x3pPlot()` function.
These scans have already undergone some pre-processing to isolate the breech face impressions, but we skip the details here.
The similarity between these cartridge cases is not immediately apparent.
We can calculate similarity features between these two scans using functions available in the `scored` package.

```{r}
x3pPlot(K013sA1,K013sA2)
```

### Full-Scan Features

To compare the two cartridge case scans, we first try to align them by determining the rotation/translation at which they are most similar.
This is a standard image processing technique called *registration* that is implemented in the `comparison_fullScan()` function.
The `thetas` argument specifies one or more rotation angles (in degrees) that we want to explore for possible registration.
The `comparison_fullScan()` function performs the registration in both "directions", meaning it first registers `K013sA2` to `K013sA1` and then registers `K013sA1` to `K013sA2`.
The `direction` column differentiates between these two sets of results.
The output is a data frame-like `tibble()` object containing results of the registration process, which are discussed in greater detail in the vignettes.

```{r,cache=TRUE}
comparisonDat_fullScan_estimRotation <- comparison_fullScan(reference = K013sA1,
                                                            target = K013sA2,
                                                            thetas = seq(-30,30,by = 3))

head(comparisonDat_fullScan_estimRotation)
```

```{r}
comparisonDat_fullScan_estimRotation %>%
  group_by(direction) %>%
  feature_aLaCarte(features = "all")
```


### Cell-based features



```{r}
comparisonData <- comparison_cellBased(reference = K013sA1,target = K013sA2,
                                       numCells = c(8,8),
                                       thetas = seq(-30,30,by = 3),
                                       direction = "both",
                                       returnX3Ps = TRUE)

comparisonData %>%
  group_by(direction) %>%
  feature_aLaCarte(features = "all",eps = 5,minPts = 5)
```
