An R package to compare cartridge cases and compute similarity scores based on their breech face impressions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of scored from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jzemmels/scored")
```

## Feature Calculation

As an example, consider two cartridge cases fired from the same Ruger SR9 semiautomatic 9-mm handgun.
Learn more about the collection of these cartridge cases [here](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249874.pdf).
The cartridge cases are uniquely identified as "K013sA1" and "K013sA2."
We assume that the markings on these cartridge cases left by the handgun during the firing process are similar.

```{r setup,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(scored)

library(cmcR)
library(impressions)
library(tidyverse)

data("K013sA1","K013sA2")
```

Below is a visual of the two cartridge case scans.
Note that these scans have already undergone some preprocessing to emphasize the breech face impression markings.
The similarity between these cartridge cases is not immediately apparent.
We can calculate similarity features between these two scans using functions available in the `scored` package.

```{r}
x3pPlot(K013sA1,K013sA2)
```

## Cell-Based Features

```{r}
comparisonData <- comparison_cellBased(reference = K013sA1,target = K013sA2,
                                       numCells = c(8,8),
                                       thetas = seq(-30,30,by = 3),
                                       direction = "both",
                                       returnX3Ps = TRUE)

comparisonData %>%
  group_by(direction) %>%
  feature_aLaCarte(features = "all",eps = 5,minPts = 5)
```


## Full-Scan Features


```{r}
comparisonDat_fullScan_estimRotation <- comparison_fullScan(K013sA1,K013sA2,
                                                            returnX3Ps = TRUE,
                                                            thetas = -3)

comparisonDat_fullScan_estimRotation %>%
  group_by(direction) %>%
  feature_aLaCarte(features = "all",eps = 5,minPts = 5)
```
